At F8 2016, Facebook announced that Microsoft is bringing [React Native to the Windows ecosystem](http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/articles/ReactNativeWindows.html), giving developers the potential to build React Native on Windows devices such as PCs, phones, and Xboxes.

Microsoft will also provide open source tools and services - such as a React Native extension for Visual Studio Code and the CodePush service - to help developers create React Native apps on the Universal Windows platform.

Eric Rozell from Microsoft has [written a blog post](https://ericroz.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/f8-app-on-windows-10-mobile/) describing how they brought the F8 App [to Windows 10 Mobile](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/f8-developer-conference/9nblggh4ntvn).
